PHP is easy, but so is a eager hooker with a STD. Node Js is just silly- deps that call on deps that call on deps is as stupidly NOT secure as it gets. Golang is nice, and 
i like it. Rust is best- objectively for many many reasons. I mostly fw rust- in my opinion it is stupidity to fw anything less. "Use Rust if you want the best performance and security"- WTF are you even coding for if you do not want performance and security?  Hey, if a new lang is pooped out by an AI robot and is superior to Rust, i would happily change. But today, Rust is god. Objectively. 

The daily prime or theo clickbait title video of the day that has a new best lang only generates constant fresh content that makes you stupider. Ask AI a set of non leading questions, and you will grasp why rust is so good. They say people believe things that they discover for themselves- a very valid point. But if you are new and only know 1 or 2 reasons why rust is better than your fave lang- you would be AMAZED to learn the ways of rust. Simply put- Rust is god.
