usaf vet (p&t). I mostly f/w rust. The more i f/w rust the more i look down on other langs. Rust is the first of a new standard of langs. Anything superior to rust would be awesome (like if ai poops out a superior lang). But today-, make no mistake. Rust is god. Learn to discern. Click video titles from former meth heads that tout the lang of the day only serve to generate bs content and make you stupider. New ppl do not know why rust is so good. Many ppl fall in love with rust then quit cuz its too hard. I guess if ur too stupid to use ai to help you, rust isn't the best lang for you because you are just not seeking the best lol. 

Most ppl are too stupid to realize that prime or theo vids make you stupider. Yeah, i said it. Lots of bs in the tech world. Many so called tech influencers make you stupider. They are not about the tech. They do not have the true heart of a teacher. All of them waste your time and make you stupider. Goood luck with that. 

My true tech hero is LaurieWired- she is honorable and the real deal! Let me be clear. Support Laurie or gtfo! :) 

The apps that have a repo for version 1 version 2 and so forth are for different stages of making a rust app. One can go back to an earlier version and branch off to a different direction. That is incredibly helpful and saves time to get up and running. Unlike so many rust apps here on git, my apps are not a pile of crap that is not intended for others to run. I do not expect apps to have anyone go through a bunch of unnecessary steps to install. So all my apps work, you can be sure of it. If you have a prob running something try reverting to a lower version of the app as it is simpler. Everyone's server is different so there is a lot of little things here and there to know. Especially for my early versions of apps, i do not have the will to make a thourough install script for each app as they are just prototypes and a starting point meant to help you or me save tons of time and just get started quickly with a working rust app to start changing. 

Lots of git ppl use git as an obfuscated pile of crap as a backup for personal code and then they try to pass it off as working code, which wastes your time. None of that bs here. I can assure you that before i upload a single app, it compiled and ran on my server.  You will find all the code i make small enough to easily feed to chat-gpt in order to make it super easy for anyone to feed the code to Ai (chat gpt or whatever) in order to audit or chage for your specific server. Lastly-, any code for apps that i mark as production will have a full, no bs install script. 

If you are making something simple like an imageboard, stop the bs! People who make apps with lots of extra files and way too much code make it impossible to feed to Ai to audit are making crap apps. . Make it as few files as possible so its easy to feed to ai to audit or change. I uploaded a few imageboards that have 1 page- main.rs. Easy to feed to ai in order to customize or audit. 

Rust is objectively superior in many ways, for many reasons. That is an objective fact.
