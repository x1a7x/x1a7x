The apps that have a repo for version 1 version 2 and so forth are for different stages of making a rust app. One can go back to an earlier version and branch off to a different direction. That is incredibly helpful and saves time to get up and running. Unlike so many rust apps here on git, my apps are not a pile of crap that is not intended for others to run. I do not expect apps to have anyone go through a bunch of unnecessary steps to install. So all my apps work, you can be sure of it. If you have a prob running something try reverting to a lower version of the app as it is simpler. Everyone's server is different so there is a lot of little things here and there to know. Especially for my early versions of apps, i do not have the will to make a thourough install script for each app as they are just prototypes and a starting point meant to help you or me save tons of time and just get started quickly with a working rust app to start changing. 

Lots of git ppl use git as an obfuscated pile of crap as a backup for personal code and then they try to pass it off as working code, which wastes your time. None of that bs here. I can assure you that before i upload a single app, it compiled and ran on my server.  You will find all the code i make small enough to easily feed to chat-gpt in order to make it super easy for anyone to feed the code to Ai (chat gpt or whatever) in order to audit or chage for your specific server. Lastly-, any code for apps that i mark as production will have a full, no bs install script. 

Rust is objectively superior in many ways, for many reasons. That is an objective fact.
