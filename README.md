PHP is easy, but so is a eager hooker with a STD. Node Js is just silly- deps that call on deps that call on deps is as stupidly NOT secure as it gets. Golang is nice, and 
i like it. Rust is best- objectively for many many reasons. I mostly fw rust- in my opinion it is stupidity to fw anything else. Hey, if a new lang is pooped out
by an AI robot and is superior to Rust, i would happily change. But today, Rust is god. Objectively.
